A simple click counter app I made in flutter to start learning it a while back, I tried to stick as best as I could to the **MVVM** pattern.
The app support material 3 dynamics colors

## Screens

in the homescreen there's a list with all created counter, where is possible to see the current value and delete them
<img src="screen/home.jpg" width="232" align="center"   vspace="2"> 


In the counter screen tap the screen to increase the counter

on the top right there's the setting to reset a coutner
